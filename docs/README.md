### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- Vanilla JavaScript and `jquery` for overall structure and game logic,
- Use Canvas to draw blocks

`tangrams.js`: this script will handle the logic for creating and updating the necessary `canvas` elements and rendering them to the DOM.


### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Setup project file (all configuration files). Learn Easel.js and plan out puzzles for each stage.

**Day 2**: start writing `tangrams.js`. Using `canvas`, be able to render blocks and grid.

**Day 3**: be able to click on different templates.


**Day 4**: Install the controls(reset,demo) for the user to interact with the game.  Style the frontend.

### Bonus features

- [ ] let users save a copy of their creative model.
